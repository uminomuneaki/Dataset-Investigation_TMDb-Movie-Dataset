# Investigate-The-TMDb-Movie-Dataset-
I made an analysis of movie dataset from TMDb. In this dataset, you can see movie datas such as casts, directors, genres,budgets, and revenue, etc. I cleaned this database to be able to read easily, and made some graphs to find trends.

The dataset is available here (https://www.google.com/url?q=https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/October/59dd1c4c_tmdb-movies/tmdb-movies.csv&sa=D&ust=1585257433409000)

In particular, I am interested in finding trends among these questions below:

①Which genres are most popular from year to year?

②What kinds of properties are associated with movies that have high revenues?

③Do longer movies have higher average votes?

④Which directors make more profit?
